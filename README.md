# weather_forecast

A new Flutter project,named a Weather Forecasting App. 

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application with JSON. We get  API from Open Weather (https://openweathermap.org/). Firstly we sign up for "open weather" and get the API key. Then search for our appropriate API and open it. Find the JSON, and hit to open it.In URL  we paste our API  key in appId  = dsjfkadfjeijfieai.
> Create New JSON from the API link.
> JSON formatting by using online JSON Format.
> Convert JSON to Dart Converter because of creating model class complex and long time issue.
> Copy and paste the Dart code into our IDE.
